        <h2>Augmented Reality</h2>
        <h3>General Overview</h3>
        <p>Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of the real-world,
            by using multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic,
            somatosensory and olfactory. AR can be defined as a system that incorporates
            three basic features: a combination of real and virtual words, real-time interaction,
            and 3D registration of virtual and real objects. The sensor information can be used
            to expend the real world or make a masking of the natural environment. This
            experience is seamlessly interwoven with the real world. It&#8217;s like a plug-in
            for the real world.</p>

        <h3>Difference between AR and VR</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AR uses a real-world setting while VR is completely virtual</li>
            <li>AR users can control their presence in the real world</li>
            <li>VR users are controlled by the system</li>
            <li>AR uses parts of the real and a virtual world  and VR only takes place in a fictional reality</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Jobs in the VR and AR Industry</h3>
        <p>In-demand jobs developing and improving VR and AR technology include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Software engineering</li>
            <li>Project management</li>
            <li>Software maintenance</li>
            <li>Graphic design</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The dangers of AR</h3>
        <p>Accidents can happen because you are distracted by the AR and therefore do not pay attention to your surroundings.
            29,370  people got injured and 256 died while playing the AR game Pok√©mon GO.</p>

        <h3>History of Argument Reality</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <lh>1901</lh><br>
                Frank Brau, an author had the first mentions the idea of an electric
                display/spectacles that overlays data onto real life. It is named a "character
                marker".</li><br>
            <li>
              <lh>1957-62</lh><br>
                Morton Heilig, a cinematographer, creates and patents a simulator called Asensorama
                with visuals, sound, vibration, and smell.></li><br>
            <li>
                <lh>1968</lh><br>
                Ivan Sutherland invents the head-mounted display and positions it as a window onto a
                virtual world.</li><br>
            <li>
                <lh>1975</lh><br>
                Myron Krueger creates Videoplace at allow users to interact with visual objects.</li><br>
            <li>
                <lh>1980</lh><br>
                The research by Gavan Lintern of the University of Illinois is the first published
                work to show the value of a head up display for teaching real-world figth skills.
                Steve Mann creates the first wearable computer, vision system eith text and graphical
                overlays ona photographically mediated scene.</li><br>
            <li>
                <lh>1981</lh><br>
                Dan Reitan geospatially maps multiple weather radar images and space-based and studio
                cameras to earth maps and abstract symbols for television weather broadcasts, bringing
                a precursor concept to augment reality to TV.</li><br>
            <li>
                <lh>1987</lh><br>
                Douglas George and Robert Morris create a working prototype of an astronomical
                telesscope-based "heads-up-display" system which super omposed in the telescope
                eyepiece, over the actual sky images, multi-intensity star, and celestial body
                images, and other relevant information.</li><br>
            <li>
                <lh>1990</lh><br>
                The term augment reality is attributed to Thoms P. Caudell, a former Boeing researcher.</li><br>
            <li>
                <lh>1992</lh><br>
                Louis Rosenberg developed one of the first functioning AR systems, called Virtual Fixtures,
                at the United States Air Force Research Laboratory---Armstrong, that demonstrated benefit
                to human perception.</li>
