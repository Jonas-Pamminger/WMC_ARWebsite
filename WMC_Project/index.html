        <h2>Augmented Reality</h2>
        <p>We are three students of the HTL-Leonding. Our website is about the Augmented Reality. We are trying to make
            structured Documents which match the 3D-model-Background. Our Goal is that we:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Let users watch 3D modules in the web</li>
            <li>A site where you can find out everything about AR</li>
            <li>Expanded the real world with our website</li>
            <li>We also what the try to cooperate with real companies</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <p>But it is still hard to work through these goals. There are still some Risks like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is to less computing power for our project</li>
            <li>It's too difficult to code it from scratch</li>
            <li>That we don't have enough time to finish it</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>But there are some Deadlines that we are going do for sure. Those Deadlines are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nice frontend</li>
            <li>The text for our information page</li>
            <li>Make a 3D models viewer in the web on a black background</li>
            <li>Try to get our 3D models in the real world</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>But also a good presentation which u can see at the end of the second Semester</p>

        <p>The static part is following these Units:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What's the different between AR and VR?</li>
            <li>How can someone use AR and VR?</li>
            <li>The history of AR and VR</li>
            <li>The risks of AR and VR</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>
        There is also a Dynamic part about our project that
        we are making a page were you can view a 3D models first on a black
        background and after that we want to bring our 3D modules on the real
        world using AR
